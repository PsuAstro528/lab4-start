# Astro 528, Lab 4

Before starting this lab, make sure you've successfully gotten setup to use git, Julia and Pluto.
The first lab contained detailed instructions for using the Jupyter Lab server to work with Pluto notebooks.

## Exercise 1:  Auto-Differentiation & Optimization
#### Goals:
- Compute derivatives and gradients via autodifferentiation.
- Compare accuracy and efficiency of optimization algorithms (gradient-free vs numerical gradients vs gradients via autodiff)
- Explore how cost of optimization algorithms scales with number of dimensions
- Compare efficiency of optimization algorithms on "easy" and "hard" target functions

## Exercise 2: Probabilistic Programming Languages
#### Goals:  
- Construct a model using the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/stable/) Probabilistic Programming Language
- Sample from prior and posterior of model

From a Pluto session, work through ex2.jl
